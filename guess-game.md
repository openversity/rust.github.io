Lets start with the Rust Project files

## Create the project folder
```
$ cargo new guessit
$ cd guessit/
```

## Initial files created by cargo new
```
$ tree
.
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

### Cargo.toml
```
$ cat Cargo.toml 
[package]
name = "guessit"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["srinivas-chundi <vasu.msbits@gmail.com>"]
edition = "2018"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
```
This is the file for defining the package dependencies
* Current package name and version
* List of Package dependencies
* git author information: Fix it and save if author details are not correct


### Cargo.lock
```
$ cat Cargo.lock 
# This file is automatically @generated by Cargo.
# It is not intended for manual editing.
[[package]]
name = "guessit"
version = "0.1.0"
```
* This is the file that locks the versions of package dependencies on first build
* Helps in maintaining the consistency of the re-builds, even after several days, even when new versions of dependent package libraries are availble;
* We will need to explicitely specify if we want to use the latest versions of those dependencies

### src/main.rs
```
$ cat src/main.rs 
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
sample main function for "hello world"
